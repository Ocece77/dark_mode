### Understanding `useContext` in React

#### Context API
The Context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It's particularly useful for sharing state across multiple components that are not directly related.

#### How it's used here:

- **Theme Context Creation:**
  - `ThemeContext` is created using `createContext()` to manage the theme state (`mode` and `toggleMode`).
  
- **Theme Provider:**
  - `ThemeProvider` component wraps the entire application with `ThemeContext.Provider`.
  - It manages the state (`mode`) and provides a function (`toggleMode`) to update the theme.

- **Consuming the Context:**
  - In `GlobalStyle` component, `useContext(ThemeContext)` is used to consume the `mode` and pass it to `DarkModeStyle`.
